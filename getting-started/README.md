# Getting Started



The iVvy API allows apps to integrate directly with the iVvy product suite. Some typical use cases include:

* Connecting a Point of Sale System to iVvy Venues
* Pushing Availability, Rates & Inventory into iVvy Venues through a Central Reservation System or Property Management System
* Connecting an Accounting Package with iVvy Events or Venues

The iVvy API is a Restful type API, and to help you get started we offer sdk libraries in [C\#](https://github.com/ivvycode/ivvy-sdk-net),  and [Javascript](https://github.com/ivvycode/ivvy-sdk-js) .
